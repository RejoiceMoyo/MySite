ByteChicX Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a passionate front-end developer and Computer Science student with a keen interest in emerging technologies. This portfolio showcases my journey in web development, featuring projects that demonstrate my skills in React.js, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Node.js. As I continue to expand my knowledge into backend development, I focus on creating interactive and user-friendly web experiences that solve real-world problems. My work reflects my commitment to clean code, responsive design, and modern development practices. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out for collaboration opportunities!
